## Translation Quality Checklist

For each capability translation, verify:

- [ ] **Jargon-free:** Would a non-technical buyer understand this?
- [ ] **Benefit-focused:** Does it answer "so what?" clearly?
- [ ] **Segment-relevant:** Is the benefit meaningful to this segment's context?
- [ ] **Provable:** Do we have evidence to back this claim?
- [ ] **Differentiated:** Does this distinguish us from alternatives?
- [ ] **Memorable:** Can sales repeat this in conversation?

---

## Competitive Framing

How do we position these capabilities vs. alternatives?

| Capability | Vs. Competitor A | Vs. Competitor B | Vs. "Do Nothing" |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| [Cap 1] | [Our advantage] | [Our advantage] | [Cost of inaction] |
| [Cap 2] | [Our advantage] | [Our advantage] | [Cost of inaction] |
| [Cap 3] | [Our advantage] | [Our advantage] | [Cost of inaction] |

## Usage Notes

**For Sales Conversations:**
- Lead with the benefit, not the capability
- Use "So What?" translation as the bridge
- Only go deep on technical specs if prospect asks

**For Marketing Content:**
- Category narrative → website homepage, brand messaging
- Capability translation → product pages, datasheets  
- Persona messages → targeted campaigns, sales decks

**For Product Launches:**
- Lead with 1-2 hero capabilities, not feature lists
- Translate everything before announcement
- Test messaging with friendly customers first
