# ABX Strategy Framework

A comprehensive Account-Based Everything (ABX) strategy framework for B2B companies with complex sales cycles, lots of personnas, high-value deals, and limited addressable markets.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Building GTM strategy for companies with <500 addressable accounts
- Deal sizes exceed $100K+ with 6+ month sales cycles
- Buying committees involve 5+ stakeholders
- Products require technical translation for business buyers
- You need to prioritize segments with limited resources
- Marketing must directly influence pipeline, not just generate awareness

This framework is designed for **complex B2B sales** where traditional demand generation fails and account-based approaches are structurally required.

---

## Core Philosophy: Marketing as Product

Treat every campaign, message, and channel as a **hypothesis to validate**, not a plan to execute.

| Traditional Marketing | Marketing as Product |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Annual messaging framework | Messaging backlog with sprint-based testing |
| Launch plan executed once | Launch as v1.0, iterated based on field data |
| Competitive analysis updated quarterly | Competitive intel as live feed from sales calls |
| Sales enablement = collateral dump | Enablement = tested talk tracks with win-rate data |
| Success = assets shipped | Success = pipeline influenced and deal velocity changed |

### The Bet Board Methodology

Every initiative is a **bet** with four components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ BET: [Name of initiative]                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ HYPOTHESIS: [What you believe will happen]                  │
│                                                             │
│ TEST: [How you will validate]                               │
│                                                             │
│ SUCCESS CRITERIA: [Measurable outcome that confirms bet]    │
│                                                             │
│ KILL CONDITION: [When to abandon and pivot]                 │
│                                                             │
│ LEARNING OUTPUT: [What you'll know regardless of outcome]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Bet Categories:**
- Messaging bets (which narrative resonates)
- Channel bets (where to invest)
- ABM motion bets (what triggers engagement)
- Product launch bets (what drives conversion)

## Framework 1: Segment-Specific vs. Synergy Analysis

Not everything needs to be rebuilt for each segment. This framework identifies what MUST differ vs. what can be REUSED.

### Segment-Specific (Must Differ)

| Dimension | Why It Must Differ |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **ICPs & Personas** | Different buyers, different motivations, different language |
| **Pain Points** | Each segment has unique problems driving urgency |
| **Pricing Strategy** | Value perception varies; commercial vs. government procurement differs |
| **Channels** | Where buyers gather and consume information varies |
| **Messaging & Positioning** | Same product, different value narrative per audience |
| **Budget Allocation** | ROI per segment differs; invest proportionally |

### Synergies (Reusable Across Segments)

| Dimension | Why It's Reusable |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Education Topics** | Core technology/market education applies broadly |
| **Technical Collateral** | Specs, datasheets, architecture diagrams are universal |
| **Product Roadmap** | Features serve multiple segments |
| **Strategic Partners** | Integrators, channel partners often span segments |
| **Success Stories** | On-orbit/in-production proof points validate for all |
| **Core Narrative** | Category-level story transcends segments |

### Template: Segment Analysis Matrix

## Framework 2: ABX Account Motions

Replace the linear funnel with **signal-driven account motions**. Each motion is triggered by observed signals, not assumptions about where accounts "sit" in a journey.

### The Five Motions

```
DETECT ──→ DECODE ──→ ENGAGE ──→ ACCELERATE ──→ EXPAND
   │          │          │            │            │
   ▼          ▼          ▼            ▼            ▼
Signal     Map the    Multi-      Close        Grow the
appears    buying     thread      the deal     account
           committee  engagement
```

### Motion Details

| Motion | Trigger Signals | Marketing Actions | Success Metrics |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **DETECT** | Policy announcement, RFI published, leadership change, contract expiring, funding round, strategic initiative announced | Account research sprint, buying committee mapping, PURE score assessment, tier assignment | Signal-to-first-touch latency (<72 hrs) |
| **DECODE** | First meeting booked, stakeholder org emerging, champion identified | Deep committee mapping, personality profiling, custom value narrative per stakeholder | # stakeholders mapped, personas engaged (target: 3+) |
| **ENGAGE** | Active evaluation confirmed, multiple touchpoints, content consumption increasing | Multi-channel surround: exec events, site visits, technical deep-dives, personalized content, ABM ads | Multi-thread penetration, content engagement depth |
| **ACCELERATE** | Proposal stage, competitive evaluation, procurement initiated | Competitive battle support, reference activation, custom ROI analysis, executive alignment | Pipeline velocity (days), competitive win rate |
| **EXPAND** | First product delivered, performance validated, satisfaction confirmed | Performance reporting, expansion narrative, peer referral program, fleet/portfolio growth pitch | Expansion rate (% entering 2nd deal discussion) |

### Signal Detection Categories

| Signal Type | Examples | Sources | Response Protocol |
|-------------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Policy/Regulatory** | New legislation, budget allocation, mandate announced | Government portals, industry news, regulatory filings | Research sprint: map decision-makers, assess timing |
| **Procurement** | RFI/RFP published, contract expiration, vendor review | Procurement portals, industry contacts, news | Immediate: assemble capture team, prepare response |
| **Leadership Change** | New CEO/CTO, new program manager, reorg announced | LinkedIn, press releases, job change alerts | Welcome outreach with executive briefing offer |
| **Competitive** | Competitor failure, delay, price increase, service issue | Industry news, sales intelligence, customer network | Targeted outreach to affected customers |
| **Strategic** | M&A activity, funding round, expansion announced | News, SEC filings, press releases | Assess fit, prepare relevant value narrative |

---

## Framework 3: PURE Problem Scoring

Score ICP tiers using the **PURE framework** to identify "hair-on-fire" accounts.

### The PURE Criteria

| Criterion | Question | Score 0-3 |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **P**ainful | How acute is the problem? Is it causing real damage today? | 0=mild, 3=severe |
| **U**rgent | Is there a forcing function (deadline, mandate, event)? | 0=no timeline, 3=imminent |
| **R**ecognized | Does the buyer know they have this problem? | 0=unaware, 3=actively seeking solution |
| **E**xpensive | What's the cost of inaction (financial, strategic, competitive)? | 0=low, 3=existential |

### Tier Assignment

| Total Score | Tier | Priority | Resource Allocation |
|-------------|------|----------|---------------------|
| 10-12 | Tier 1: Hair-on-Fire | Highest | Dedicated account team, custom everything |
| 7-9 | Tier 2: Burning Platform | High | Proactive outreach, personalized content |
| 4-6 | Tier 3: Active Pain | Medium | Targeted campaigns, scaled personalization |
| 1-3 | Tier 4: Emerging Need | Lower | Nurture programs, educational content |
| 0 | Tier 5: Future Potential | Lowest | Light touch, brand awareness only |

### Template: Account PURE Scorecard

```markdown
## Account: [Company Name]

### PURE Assessment
| Criterion | Score (0-3) | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Painful | [X] | [Why this score] |
| Urgent | [X] | [Why this score] |
| Recognized | [X] | [Why this score] |
| Expensive | [X] | [Why this score] |
| **TOTAL** | [X/12] | **Tier: [X]** |

### Buying Committee (Known)
| Name | Title | Role in Decision | Engagement Status |
|------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| | | Champion / Influencer / Blocker / Decision-maker | Cold / Warm / Engaged |

### Next Actions
1. [Action]
2. [Action]

## Framework 4: Message Resonance System

Creating content is not enough. This system ensures messages **actually land**.

### The Five Components

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   MESSAGE RESONANCE SYSTEM                  │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Message Resonance Rate (MRR)

The key leading indicator: **% of sales conversations where the prospect uses your language back**.

Track via conversation intelligence (Gong, Chorus) by monitoring:
- Keyword adoption (do they say "dedicated capacity" or "shared bandwidth"?)
- Objection patterns (are we addressing the right concerns?)
- Competitive mentions (how are we being compared?)

**Target: 40%+ of qualified meetings show message adoption.**

---

## Framework 5: Capability-to-Benefit Translation

Technical products require **systematic translation** from what it does to why it matters.

### The Translation Hierarchy

```
Layer 1: CATEGORY NARRATIVE
         "Why this matters to the world"
              │
              ▼
Layer 2: CAPABILITY → BENEFIT TRANSLATION
         "What it does → So what? → Why you care"
              │
              ▼
Layer 3: PERSONA-SPECIFIC MESSAGES
         "Tailored value prop per buyer type"
```

### Template: Capability Translation Matrix

| Technical Capability | So What? (Translation) | Benefit: Segment A | Benefit: Segment B |
|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| [Technical feature] | [Plain language explanation] | [Value for segment A buyer] | [Value for segment B buyer] |
| [Technical feature] | [Plain language explanation] | [Value for segment A buyer] | [Value for segment B buyer] |

### Template: Persona Message Map

| Persona | What They Care About | Message Frame | Proof Points |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| CEO/Board | Strategic positioning, competitive advantage, ROI | "[Strategic value prop]" | [Evidence] |
| CTO/Technical | Specs, integration, performance, reliability | "[Technical value prop]" | [Evidence] |
| CFO/Finance | TCO, payback period, risk mitigation | "[Financial value prop]" | [Evidence] |
| Ops/User | Ease of use, support, day-to-day experience | "[Operational value prop]" | [Evidence] |
| Procurement | Compliance, risk, vendor stability | "[Risk mitigation prop]" | [Evidence] |

---

## Framework 6: Constant Discovery Mindset

Every engagement generates learnings. This framework captures and applies them.

### The Four Discovery Questions

Before, during, and after every deal:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Do we know and understand the PLAYERS?                   │
│    Who are the real decision-makers vs. influencers?        │
│    Who can kill the deal? Who's the hidden blocker?         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Do we understand the RELATIONSHIPS?                      │
│    Internal dynamics? External advisors? Political factors? │
│    Who trusts whom? Who competes internally?                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Do we understand the INFLUENCING FACTORS?                │
│    Budget cycles? Regulatory timelines? Competitive moves?  │
│    Internal mandates? Strategic priorities?                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Do we know the DECISION FACTORS?                         │
│    Technical requirements? Commercial terms? Risk tolerance?│
│    Timeline constraints? Evaluation criteria?               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Win/Loss Analysis Framework

| Dimension | Questions to Answer | How to Capture |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|
| Decision Criteria | What were the top 3 factors? Were these what we expected? | Post-decision debrief |
| Buying Process | Who was the real decision-maker? Who influenced most? | Sales team debrief, call analysis |
| Messaging Effectiveness | Which messages resonated? Which fell flat? | Keyword analysis, champion feedback |
| Competitive Dynamics | Who else considered? What did they say about us? | Direct inquiry, third-party research |
| Timeline & Process | Faster or slower than expected? What caused delays? | CRM tracking, sales input |

---

## Framework 7: Learning Loop Architecture

Structured cadence for turning field data into strategy improvements.

| Cadence | Inputs | Decisions | Outputs |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|

| **Scaling (1→10)** | Demand Generation (40%) | Sales Enablement (30%) | ABM campaigns, event presence, thought leadership at scale |
| **Market Leader** | Demand Generation (45%) | Customer Marketing (25%) | Expansion, reference program, ecosystem development |

---

## Framework 9: Customer Journey Mapping

Map both internal (your team) and external (customer) activities across the journey.

### Template: Journey Map

| Stage | Customer Activities | Your Internal Activities | Key Stakeholders | Marketing Deliverables |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|

| **Expansion** | Performance review, additional use cases, renewal | Performance reporting, expansion pitch, reference program | Exec sponsor, ops | Performance report, expansion narrative, case study |

---

## Framework 10: Collaterals with Success Metrics

Every asset should have defined success metrics. Track not just creation, but effectiveness.

| Asset Type | Purpose | Success Metrics | Review Cadence |
|------------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| ROI/TCO Calculator | Self-service economic comparison | % of meetings where used, conversion rate | Monthly |
| Technical Datasheets | Spec validation for technical buyers | Time-on-page, download rate, sales feedback | Quarterly |

---

## Quick Reference: Power Phrases

Use these frames in strategy discussions:

- **"Hypothesis → Test → Learn → Iterate"** — not plan and execute
- **"Learning velocity over planning perfection"** — especially at 0→1
- **"The market tells us, we don't tell the market"** — ground strategy in signals
- **"Multi-threading is mandatory"** — complex deals require parallel engagement
- **"Take the complex and make it simple"** — the core PMM challenge
- **"Proven, not promised"** — flight heritage / production deployment matters
- **"Every campaign is a bet with a kill condition"** — no sacred cows
