# Modern Product Operating Model

> "A modern product operating model starts with clear strategic intent, continuously discovers customer problems, turns them into value-based bets, structures solutions into product blocks and features, executes with tight GTM and measurement loops, and constantly feeds learning back into strategy."

This is a collection of **6 composable skills** for product leadership. Each skill is standalone but designed to work together as a complete operating system.

## Core Philosophy

### What This Framework Believes

1. **Strategy is choice, not documentation** — If you haven't said no to something, you don't have a strategy
2. **Prototypes over PRDs** — A working prototype communicates more than any slide deck
3. **Outcomes over outputs** — Teams are accountable for results, not deliverables
4. **Learning velocity is the meta-metric** — The team that learns fastest wins
5. **AI is baseline, not bonus** — Coming to a meeting without AI-assisted prep is like coming without reading the doc
6. **Focus is a superpower** — 1-3 P0 priorities maximum

### What This Framework Rejects

- **PM Theater**: Polishing documents nobody reads
- **Decision by committee**: Consensus produces mediocre products
- **Annual planning fiction**: You don't know what to build a year from now
- **Process over product**: If process doesn't serve the user, kill it
- **Feature factories**: Building what stakeholders request vs. solving real problems

## The Learning Loop

The systems connect in a continuous learning loop:

```
STRATEGY defines where to play and how to win
    ↓
DISCOVERY finds problems worth solving
    ↓
PRODUCT structures bets and roadmap
    ↓
DELIVERY ships and measures
    ↓
LEARNING feeds back to STRATEGY
    ↑
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Information Flow

| From | To | What Flows |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Strategy | Discovery | ICP, JTBD priorities, strategic bets |
| Discovery | Product | Validated opportunities, solution candidates |
| Product | Delivery | Bets, solution briefs, success metrics |
| Delivery | Discovery | Usage data, feedback, outcome evidence |
| Delivery | Strategy | Market learning, competitive signals, bet results |

---

## Three Operating Modes

| Dimension | 0→1 Mode | Scaling Mode | AI-Native Mode |
|-----------|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Strategy refresh | Weekly pivots | Quarterly | + Agency-control decisions |
| Team structure | 4-6 builders | Multiple trios | + ML engineers |
| Block focus | Single block | Multi-block | + Calibration metrics |
| Discovery | Founder-led | Systematic | + Observe AI interactions |
| Delivery | Ship daily | Staged rollout | + Agency graduation |
| Planning | 4-6 weeks | 12-18 months | + Continuous calibration |
