# Strategic Bet Template

Use this template to structure strategic bets with clear hypotheses, success criteria, and kill conditions. A bet without kill criteria is just a project.

## Bet: [BET NAME]

**ID:** [BET-001]  
**Owner:** [NAME]  
**Created:** [DATE]  
**Status:** [ ] Proposed  [ ] Active  [ ] Validated  [ ] Killed  [ ] Scaled

---

## Classification

**Bet Category:**
- [ ] Value creation (new capabilities that solve customer problems)
- [ ] Growth (acquisition, activation, expansion)
- [ ] Platform (infrastructure, scalability, efficiency)
- [ ] Trust (security, performance, compliance)
- [ ] Moat (building defensibility)

**Portfolio Position:**
- [ ] Core (70% — proven, incremental)
- [ ] Adjacent (20% — related, moderate risk)
- [ ] Transformational (10% — new, high risk)

**Strategic Connection:**
- Objective this supports: [Link to strategy canvas objective]
- How this builds our moat: [Connection to superpower/moat thesis]

---

## Hypothesis

**We believe that:**
> [Action we will take]

**For:**
> [Target user segment]

**Will result in:**
> [Outcome we expect]

**Because:**
> [Rationale based on evidence — customer quotes, data, market signals]

---

## Evidence Base

**What evidence supports this bet?**

| Evidence Type | Summary | Confidence |
|--------------|---------|------------|
| Customer interviews | [X interviews mentioning this problem] | High / Medium / Low |
| Usage data | [Relevant patterns] | High / Medium / Low |
| Competitive analysis | [What competitors do/don't do] | High / Medium / Low |
| Market signals | [Trends, analyst reports] | High / Medium / Low |
| Previous experiments | [What we've learned] | High / Medium / Low |

**Key customer quotes:**
> "[Quote 1]" — [Role, Company type]

> "[Quote 2]" — [Role, Company type]

**Overall confidence level:** [ ] High (70%+)  [ ] Medium (40-70%)  [ ] Low (<40%)

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metric

| Element | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Metric** | [Specific metric name] |
| **Current baseline** | [Current value] |
| **Target** | [Success threshold] |
| **Measurement method** | [How we'll track] |

### Secondary Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Purpose |
|--------|----------|--------|---------|
| [Metric 1] | [X] | [Y] | [Why it matters] |
| [Metric 2] | [X] | [Y] | [Why it matters] |

### Guardrail Metrics

> Guardrails are metrics we won't let degrade while pursuing the primary metric.

| Guardrail | Threshold | Action if Breached |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Don't go below X] | [What we'll do] |
| [Metric 2] | [Don't go below X] | [What we'll do] |

---

## Timebox & Milestones

**Total duration:** [X weeks]

| Milestone | Date | Deliverable | Decision Point |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------------|
| Kick-off | [Date] | Team aligned, metrics instrumented | Go / No-go |
| Check-in 1 | [Date] | [Early signals] | Continue / Adjust / Kill |
| Check-in 2 | [Date] | [Mid-point data] | Continue / Adjust / Kill |
| Final review | [Date] | [Full results] | Scale / Iterate / Kill |

---

## Riskiest Assumptions

> Validate riskiest assumptions first. Don't polish secondary features while core hypothesis remains unproven.

| Assumption | Risk Level | Test Method | Test Duration |
|------------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| [Assumption 1 — the one that kills us if wrong] | High | [How to test] | [Hours/days] |
| [Assumption 2] | Medium | [How to test] | [Hours/days] |
| [Assumption 3] | Low | [How to test] | [Hours/days] |

**Test before building:**
> [Specific test we'll run before committing engineering resources]

---

## Decision Criteria

### Kill Criteria

We will **stop this bet** if:

| Condition | Threshold | Timeline |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Primary metric doesn't move | [< X% improvement] | [By week Y] |
| Guardrail is breached | [Metric drops below X] | [Any time] |
| Riskiest assumption disproved | [Test fails] | [During validation] |
| Resource constraint | [If X happens] | [Any time] |

### Scale Criteria

We will **double down** if:

| Condition | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Primary metric exceeds target | [> X] | [Expand to more users / Invest more] |
| Unexpected positive signal | [Y emerges] | [Explore adjacent opportunity] |
| Competitive window opens | [Z happens] | [Accelerate timeline] |

### Iterate Criteria

We will **adjust and continue** if:

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Metric moving but not at target | Identify blockers, extend timebox |
| Unexpected objection pattern | Adjust solution, re-test |
| Implementation harder than expected | Reduce scope to thin slice |

## Resources Required

| Resource | Allocation | Duration |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Product | [X% of PM time] | [X weeks] |
| Design | [X% of designer time] | [X weeks] |
| Engineering | [X engineers] | [X weeks] |
| Other | [Specify] | [X weeks] |

**Total investment:** [T-shirt size: S / M / L / XL]

**Dependencies:**
- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]
