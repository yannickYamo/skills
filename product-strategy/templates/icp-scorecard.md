## Anti-ICP (Who We Don't Serve)

> Anti-ICP is as important as ICP. Every prospect that doesn't fit costs time, distorts product, and drains resources.

### Explicit Exclusions

| Segment | Why We Don't Serve | What Happens If We Try |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------|
| [Segment 1] | [Reason: wrong economics / wrong fit / wrong timing] | [Consequence: long sales cycle / churn / support burden] |
| [Segment 2] | [Reason] | [Consequence] |
| [Segment 3] | [Reason] | [Consequence] |
| [Segment 4] | [Reason] | [Consequence] |

### Anti-ICP Warning Signs

These signals indicate a prospect is Anti-ICP:

| Warning Sign | Why It's a Problem |
|--------------|-------------------|
| [Signal 1] | [Creates X problem] |
| [Signal 2] | [Creates X problem] |
| [Signal 3] | [Creates X problem] |
| [Signal 4] | [Creates X problem] |

### How to Say No

When Anti-ICP prospects appear:

**For inbound:**
> "[Polite decline script that maintains relationship but doesn't waste time]"

**For sales pressure:**
> "[Internal talking points for why we don't pursue this segment]"

**Referral option:**
> [Alternative solution to recommend]
