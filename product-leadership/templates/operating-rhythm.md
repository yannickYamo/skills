- [ ] Async first when possible

### No-Meeting Time

|----------|---------------|
| [Day] [Time] | Deep work / Discovery |
| [Day] [Time] | No internal meetings |

---

## Communication Channels

| Channel | Use For | Response Time |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Slack #product | Quick questions, updates | Same day |
| Email | External, formal | 24-48 hours |
| [Doc system] | Decisions, specs, plans | Async review |
| Meetings | Discussions, decisions | Scheduled |

---

## Rhythm Health Check

Quarterly, assess:

- [ ] Are we meeting too much or too little?
- [ ] Are the right people in the right meetings?
- [ ] Are meetings producing decisions?
- [ ] Is async working?
- [ ] Do teams have enough uninterrupted time?
- [ ] Are we over-processing or under-coordinating?
