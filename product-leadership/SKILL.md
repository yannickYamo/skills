## The Leadership Shift

### IC PM vs. Product Leader

| Dimension | IC PM | Product Leader |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **Output** | Ship features, move metrics | Build teams that ship and move metrics |
| **Discovery** | Do discovery | Ensure discovery happens across teams |
| **Decisions** | Make product decisions | Create systems for good decisions |
| **Influence** | Team + stakeholders | Organization + executives + board |
| **Success** | Your product wins | Your PMs and products win |
| **Time horizon** | Quarters | Years |

### The Three Jobs of Product Leadership

1. **Set Direction** — Portfolio strategy, resource allocation, what to build/not build
2. **Build Capability** — Hire, coach, develop PMs; establish systems and processes
3. **Remove Obstacles** — Unblock teams, align executives, navigate politics

---

## Framework Components

### 1. Portfolio Management

**The Portfolio View**

As a leader, you manage a portfolio of products/bets, not a single product.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     PRODUCT PORTFOLIO                           │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬──────────┤
│   Product A     │   Product B     │   Product C     │ Product D│
│   [Cash Cow]    │   [Star]        │   [Question]    │ [Dog]    │
│   Maintain      │   Invest        │   Decide        │ Sunset?  │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴──────────┘
```

**Portfolio Categories (BCG-style)**

| Category | Characteristics | Strategy |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Stars** | High growth, high share | Invest heavily |
| **Cash Cows** | Low growth, high share | Maintain, harvest |
| **Question Marks** | High growth, low share | Invest or divest |
| **Dogs** | Low growth, low share | Sunset or pivot |

**Resource Allocation Questions**

- Where are we over/under-invested relative to opportunity?
- Which products deserve more resources? Fewer?
- What would we stop doing to fund something new?
- Are we spreading too thin or concentrating appropriately?

**Portfolio Review Cadence**: Quarterly

### 2. Executive Alignment

**The Alignment Challenge**

Product leaders translate between:
- Customer needs ↔ Business objectives
- Team capabilities ↔ Executive expectations
- Long-term bets ↔ Short-term pressures

**Stakeholder Map**

| Stakeholder | Cares About | Your Job |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **CEO** | Company strategy, major bets, competitive position | Align product to company strategy, flag strategic choices |
| **CFO** | Revenue, costs, unit economics | Connect product to financial outcomes |
| **CTO** | Technical strategy, platform health, eng efficiency | Partner on build vs. buy, technical investments |
| **Sales** | Pipeline, quota, competitive wins | Enable sales, balance custom vs. scalable |
| **Marketing** | Positioning, launches, demand gen | Coordinate GTM, provide product narrative |
| **Board** | Growth, market position, key metrics | Simplify complexity, show progress |

**Managing Up Principles**

1. **No surprises** — Flag risks early, even if uncomfortable
2. **Options, not just problems** — Bring recommendations
3. **Translate to their language** — Business impact, not feature details
4. **Build trust through delivery** — Track record enables autonomy
5. **Pick your battles** — Not everything is worth escalating

**Executive Review Format**

| Section | Content | Time |
|---------|---------|------|
| Progress | Key wins, metrics moved | 5 min |
| Risks | What could go wrong, mitigation | 5 min |
| Decisions needed | Choices requiring exec input | 10 min |
| Forward look | Next quarter priorities | 5 min |

---

### 3. Board Communication

**What Boards Care About**

| Topic | Board Question | Your Preparation |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Growth** | Are we growing? Why/why not? | Key metrics, trend, drivers |
| **Product-market fit** | Do customers love it? | NPS, retention, expansion |
| **Competitive position** | Are we winning? | Win rates, market share |
| **Roadmap confidence** | Will you deliver? | Track record, risks |
| **Team** | Do we have the right people? | Org health, key hires |

**Board Metrics (Keep Simple)**

| Metric | Why It Matters | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **ARR/Revenue** | Business health | [Target] |
| **Growth rate** | Trajectory | [Target]% |
| **Retention** | Product stickiness | [Target]% |
| **NPS** | Customer love | [Target] |
| **Activation** | New user success | [Target]% |

**Board Slide Principles**

- One message per slide
- Metrics with context (vs. target, vs. last period)
- Honest about challenges
- Clear asks if any
- No jargon, no feature lists

**Common Board Questions to Prepare For**

- "What's the biggest risk to hitting plan?"
- "Why should customers choose us over [competitor]?"
- "What would you do with more resources?"
- "What's taking longer than expected and why?"
- "What's the one thing keeping you up at night?"

### 4. Team Structure

**Product Team Models**

| Model | Structure | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Feature teams** | Team owns feature area | Clear boundaries, simple coordination |
| **Mission teams** | Team owns outcome/metric | Outcome focus, cross-functional |
| **Platform + Product** | Platform serves product teams | Scale, shared infrastructure |
| **Pods/Squads** | Small autonomous units | Speed, ownership |

**Team Sizing Guidelines**

| Team Size | Characteristics |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **4-6** | Tight, fast, 0→1 mode |
| **6-10** | Standard product team |
| **10+** | Consider splitting |

**The Product Trio at Scale**

```
         Product Leader
              │
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    │         │         │
  PM A      PM B      PM C
    │         │         │
 [Trio]    [Trio]    [Trio]
```

Each PM leads a trio (PM + Designer + Tech Lead). Product Leader coaches PMs, not trios directly.

**Hiring Principles**

| Level | Look For |
|-------|----------|
| **Junior PM** | Curiosity, analytical ability, communication, coachability |
| **Senior PM** | Track record, strategic thinking, influence, autonomy |
| **PM Lead** | Team building, coaching, systems thinking, exec presence |

**PM Career Ladder Dimensions**

- Scope (feature → product → portfolio)
- Complexity (clear → ambiguous)
- Influence (team → org → company)
- Autonomy (guided → independent → guiding others)

---

### 5. Operating Rhythm

**The Operating Calendar**

| Cadence | Activity | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Daily** | Standups (teams) | Execution alignment |
| **Weekly** | PM sync | Cross-team coordination |
| **Weekly** | 1:1s with PMs | Coaching, unblocking |
| **Bi-weekly** | Product review | Progress, decisions |
| **Monthly** | Metrics review | Performance assessment |
| **Quarterly** | Planning | Prioritization, resourcing |
| **Quarterly** | Portfolio review | Strategic alignment |
| **Annually** | Strategy refresh | Direction setting |

**Weekly PM Sync (60 min)**

| Segment | Time | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Wins & learnings | 15 min | Celebrate, share knowledge |
| Cross-team dependencies | 20 min | Unblock, coordinate |
| Escalations | 15 min | Decisions needed from leader |
| Announcements | 10 min | Org updates, process changes |

**Quarterly Planning Process**

| Week | Activity |
|------|----------|
| Week -4 | Strategy inputs gathered (market, customers, data) |
| Week -3 | Leadership alignment on priorities |
| Week -2 | Teams develop proposals |
| Week -1 | Review, negotiate, finalize |
| Week 0 | Communicate and kick off |

**1:1 Structure with PMs**

| Topic | Questions |
|-------|-----------|
| **Progress** | What's going well? What's stuck? |
| **Support** | What do you need from me? |
| **Development** | What are you learning? Where do you want to grow? |
| **Strategy** | Any concerns about direction? |
| **Personal** | How are you doing? |

---

### 6. Culture & Principles

**Building Product Culture**

| Principle | What It Looks Like |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Customer obsession** | Every PM talks to customers weekly |
| **Outcome over output** | Teams celebrate metrics, not launches |
| **Evidence-based** | Decisions cite data or research |
| **Bias to action** | Ship → learn → iterate beats planning |
| **Psychological safety** | PMs can flag risks without fear |
| **Intellectual honesty** | We say what's not working |

**Anti-Patterns to Fix**

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|--------------|---------|-----|
| **Feature factory** | Teams build what's requested | Outcome-based goals |
| **PM as project manager** | PMs track tasks, not strategy | Elevate PM role, coach |
| **Stakeholder-driven** | Loudest voice wins | Evidence-based prioritization |
| **Hero culture** | Individual heroics save the day | Systems and processes |
| **Analysis paralysis** | Endless research, no shipping | Timeboxes, thin slices |

**Defending Product Time**

As leader, protect your teams from:
- Stakeholder pet projects
- Excessive meetings
- Scope creep
- Reactive firefighting
- Process theater

### 7. Coaching PMs

**Coaching vs. Directing**

| Directing | Coaching |
|-----------|----------|
| "Do X" | "What options are you considering?" |
| "The answer is Y" | "What does the data suggest?" |
| "I would do Z" | "What's your recommendation?" |

**Coaching Questions**

| Situation | Questions |
|-----------|-----------|
| **PM is stuck** | "What have you tried? What's blocking you?" |
| **PM wants validation** | "What's your conviction level? What would change your mind?" |
| **PM made a mistake** | "What did you learn? What would you do differently?" |
| **PM is succeeding** | "What made this work? How can you replicate it?" |

**Development Conversations**

| PM Level | Focus Areas |
|----------|-------------|
| **Junior** | Discovery skills, stakeholder management, shipping |
| **Senior** | Strategic thinking, influence without authority, ambiguity |
| **Lead** | Team building, coaching others, exec communication |

**Feedback Framework**

1. **Situation**: What happened (specific)
2. **Behavior**: What the PM did
3. **Impact**: Effect on outcome
4. **Request/Suggestion**: What to do differently
