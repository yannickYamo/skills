## Decision

### Decision Framework

|---------|----------|---------------|
| **SCALE** | Primary metric hit, positive signal, no guardrail issues | [Does this apply?] |
| **ITERATE** | Positive signal but not at target, clear hypothesis for improvement | [Does this apply?] |
| **KILL** | Hypothesis disproved, or signal too weak to justify continued investment | [Does this apply?] |

### Our Decision

**Decision:** [ ] SCALE  [ ] ITERATE  [ ] KILL

**Rationale:**
> [2-3 sentences explaining why this is the right decision]

**Confidence:** [ ] High  [ ] Medium  [ ] Low

**Dissenting views (if any):**
> [Capture any disagreement for the record]
