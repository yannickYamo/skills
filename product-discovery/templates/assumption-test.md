## Test Overview

**Test Name:** [Descriptive name]  
**Test ID:** [TEST-001]  
**Owner:** [Name]  
**Created:** [Date]  
**Status:** [ ] Planned  [ ] In Progress  [ ] Complete

## The Assumption

**Assumption Statement:**
> We believe that [specific belief about users/market/solution]

**Which solution is this for?**
> [Link to solution in OST]

**Assumption Category:**
- [ ] **Desirability** — Will users want this?
- [ ] **Viability** — Will this work for the business?
- [ ] **Feasibility** — Can we build this?
- [ ] **Usability** — Can users figure it out?

**Risk Level:** [ ] High  [ ] Medium  [ ] Low

**Why this assumption matters:**
> [What happens if we're wrong? Why test this first?]

---

## Test Design

**Test Method:**
- [ ] Desk research (30 min)
- [ ] One-question survey (1 hour)
- [ ] Fake door test (1 day)
- [ ] Concierge test (1-3 days)
- [ ] Wizard of Oz (1 week)
- [ ] Prototype test (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] A/B test (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Other: [Specify]

**Test Description:**
> [What specifically will we do?]

**Participants/Sample:**
- Who: [Target users]
- How many: [Sample size]
- How recruited: [Recruitment method]

**Timebox:** [Duration — hours or days, not weeks]

---

## Success Criteria

**We will consider this assumption VALIDATED if:**
> [Specific, measurable criteria]

| Metric | Threshold for Success |
|--------|----------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [X% or number] |
| [Metric 2] | [X% or number] |

**We will consider this assumption INVALIDATED if:**
> [Specific criteria that would disprove]

| Metric | Threshold for Failure |
|--------|----------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Below X%] |
| [Metric 2] | [Below X%] |

**We will consider results INCONCLUSIVE if:**
> [What would leave us uncertain — and what we'd do next]

## Conclusion

**Assumption status:** [ ] Validated  [ ] Invalidated  [ ] Inconclusive

**Confidence level:** [ ] High  [ ] Medium  [ ] Low

**Summary:**
> [2-3 sentences on what we learned]

---

## Decision & Next Steps

**Decision made:**
> [What we decided based on results]

**Rationale:**
> [Why this is the right call]

**Next steps:**
- [ ] [Action 1]
- [ ] [Action 2]
- [ ] [Action 3]

**If validated:** [What we'll do next — proceed to build? Test another assumption?]

**If invalidated:** [What we'll do — pivot? Test different solution? Park opportunity?]

---

## Test Quality Check

Before concluding:

- [ ] Results are from target users (not just convenient users)
- [ ] Sample size is reasonable for the decision
- [ ] We tested the riskiest assumption (not the easiest)
- [ ] Criteria were set before seeing results (no moving goalposts)
- [ ] Trio has reviewed and agrees on interpretation
- [ ] Results are documented for future reference
