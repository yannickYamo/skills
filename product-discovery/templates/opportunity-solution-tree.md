# Opportunity Solution Tree (OST) Template

Use this template to build and maintain your living map of outcome → opportunities → solutions → tests.

---

## Outcome

> The measurable result you're trying to achieve. One outcome per tree.

**Outcome Statement:** [Metric we're trying to move]

**Current baseline:** [Current value]  
**Target:** [Goal value]  
**Timeframe:** [By when]

**Why this outcome matters:**
> [Connection to strategy / business impact]

---

## Opportunities

> Opportunities are unmet needs or problems. NOT solutions.
> Good: "Users struggle to..." Bad: "We need to build..."

## OST Health Check

**Last updated:** [Date]  
**Updated by:** [Name]

- [ ] Outcome is still the right focus
- [ ] All opportunities have evidence (not just opinions)
- [ ] Target opportunity has 3+ solutions explored
- [ ] Riskiest assumptions identified and being tested
- [ ] No solutions without parent opportunities
- [ ] Tree reviewed with full trio this week

---

## OST Rules Reminder

1. **One outcome per tree** — Don't try to solve everything
2. **Opportunities are problems, not solutions** — "Users struggle to..." not "Build a..."
3. **Multiple solutions per opportunity** — Always 3+ before committing
4. **Evidence-backed** — If no evidence, it's a guess
5. **Living document** — Update weekly
